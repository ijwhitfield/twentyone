 Blackjack-adjacent networked game I made for AP Computer Science in late 2018. The game uses a client-server architecture to host connections, with a Jar shared between the two for common classes. For UI, it uses Lanterna, which means that in theory it can run as a TUI application in your terminal emulator.
